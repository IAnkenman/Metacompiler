Rewrite hashmap.c to use linear probing

Test hashmap.c

Debug regex.c

Create NFA interpreter in lexer.c to analyse tokens based on a set of DFA's generated from lexer rules and allow swapping NFAs mid analysis

Redesign meta language to remove user defined ids from top level scope and use freeform syntax

Get rid of the concept of #USING lexers in the original language. Have the parser generate lexical analysers from tokens sets derived from the grammar automatically.

Implement set.c as a balanced binary tree


//OPTIMIZATION

More efficently compute the character sets used in DFA traversal from a set of NFA edges in regex.c
